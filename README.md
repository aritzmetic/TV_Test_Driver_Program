## **INTRODUCTION**
> _The program, which is called Television Tester, is an OOP simulation of a television and its features. The code demonstrates the usage of class variables, instance variables, and constructors to make and break TV objects. A blue ASCII art–styled message reading "OOP" is displayed in the console with formatting provided by the pyfiglet library once the application begins. After asking for the user's name, the application introduces itself and explains that it will aid them in navigating their televisions. In sum, the introduction sets the conditions for a warm and engaging display that simulates TV environments and allows users to test their tvs' abilities._
