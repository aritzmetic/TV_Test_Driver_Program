## **INTRODUCTION**
> _The program, which is called Television Tester, is an OOP simulation of a television and its features. The code demonstrates the usage of class variables, instance variables, and constructors to make and break TV objects. A blue ASCII art–styled message reading "OOP" is displayed in the console with formatting provided by the pyfiglet library once the application begins. After asking for the user's name, the application introduces itself and explains that it will aid them in navigating their televisions. In sum, the introduction sets the conditions for a warm and engaging display that simulates TV environments and allows users to test their tvs' abilities._

### **PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE USED**
> Python

## **Attributes**
- > Utilization of **third-party librarie**s such as time, pyfiglet, random, and termcolor
- > initiation of a **new class denoted as TV**
- > **Use of instance variables** for determining the channel, volume, and whether or not the television is on
- > Detailed explanation of a **constructor** that is responsible for initializing the instance variables
- > **Utilization of class variables** for minimum_channel, maximum_channel, minimum_volume, and maximum_volume respectively
- > Definition of instance **methods,** such as turnOn() and turnOff(), getChannel() and setChannel(), getVolume() and setVolume(), channelUp() and channelDown(), volumeUp() and volumeDown(), and channelUp() and channelDown()
- > The **try-except block** was implemented in the test driver's program.
- > Make use of a **while loop to ensure that the software continues to run** until the user presses the exit button.
- > **Existence of helpful comments** that elucidates the operation of the program on a component-by-component basis.
