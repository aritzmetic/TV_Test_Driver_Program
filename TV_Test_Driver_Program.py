# Delera, Aritz B.

# Exercise:
# Given: A UML Class Diagram below:
# Required: Create a Python Code for creating the Class named TV
# and a Test Driver program named TestTV that will create two objects from Class TV 
# and will produce the following output:

# PSEUDOCODE
# Create Class 
# Use Class Variable to initialize the values of channel and volume
# Create Constructor
# Create Instances
# Turn on the TV
# Turn off the TV
# Get the Channel
# Set the Channel
# Get the Volume
# Set the Volume
# Use channelUp to increment the channel by 1 if it is in a minimum value
# Use channelDown to decrement the channel by 1 if it is in a maximum value
# Use volumeUp to increment the volume by 1 if it is in a minimum value
# Use volumeDown to decrement the volume by 1 if it is in a maximum value

# Create test driver program class named TestTV
# Create two instances; tv1 and tv2
# Print the intances
